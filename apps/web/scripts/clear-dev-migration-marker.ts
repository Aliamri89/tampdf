 * `payload migrate` interactively prompts ("data loss will occur, proceed?")
 * whenever it finds a `batch: -1` row in `payload-migrations` — the marker
 * Payload's dev-mode schema push writes when `next dev` is pointed at a
 * database. That prompt has no non-interactive override, so it hangs/crashes
 * a CI build with no TTY attached (see Hostinger build logs).
 *
 * This only removes that internal bookkeeping marker, never real content —
 * `payload migrate` still runs the actual migration files normally after.
 * Runs before `payload migrate` in the `build` script so production builds
 * can never hit that prompt, regardless of whether dev mode was ever run
 * against this database.
